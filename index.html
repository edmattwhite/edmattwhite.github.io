<h1>Home</h1>
<p>This website is (right now) relatively incomplete, but it was put here in the theme of a tip from Richard Hamming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I knew that most people who took a sabbatical to write a book, didn’t finish it on time. So before I left, I told all my friends that when I come back, that book was going to be done! Yes, I would have it done - I’d have been ashamed to come back without it! I used my ego to make myself behave the way I wanted to. I bragged about something so I’d have to perform. I found out many times, like a cornered rat in a real trap, I was surprisingly capable. I have found that it paid to say, “Oh yes, I’ll get the answer for you Tuesday,” not having any idea how to do it. By Sunday night I was really hard thinking on how I was going to deliver by Tuesday. I often put my pride on the line and sometimes I failed, but as I said, like a cornered rat I’m surprised how often I did a good job. I think you need to learn to use yourself. I think you need to know how to convert a situation from one view to another which would increase the chance of success.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such, I’m putting a list on the front page of the articles that I plan to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variational Inference.</li>
<li>What is mean field variational inference?</li>
<li>Euler Lagrange.</li>
<li>Gibbs Sampling.</li>
<li>HMC.</li>
<li>Gradient Ascent.</li>
<li>What is the point of a maximium entropy distribution and how do I find one?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Articles:</h3>
