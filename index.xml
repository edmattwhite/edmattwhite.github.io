Mostly these are explanations of things that I found tricky to begin with and wished for an explanation written by myself in the future once I did understand them!
I&amp;rsquo;m interested in maths (at the moment mostly statistics/probability and computational methods around them), music and rowing.</description></item></channel></rss>
