I'm currently an MSc. student at Imperial College London -- this is my personal website, which is where I put things that I find interesting when I get the time to write about them.
Mostly these are explanations of things that I found tricky to begin with and wished for an explanation written by myself in the future once I did understand them!

I'm interested in maths (at the moment mostly statistics/probability and computational methods around them), music and rowing.
